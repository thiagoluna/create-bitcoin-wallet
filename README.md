## ðŸ’» Project

This project allows to create a Bitcoin Wallet on Bitcoin Blockchain.  
The code is simple but functional. The Wallet was created in Bitcoin Testnet Faucet (bitcoin.networks.testnet) and 
linked on Electrum to manage the transactions.

I use https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/ to send tBTC to my wallet.  
I see the transactions on https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/
